ModFox is a classy platform game designed to get young learners excited about computer science through modding! Players of this educational game help the fox collect coins and can only win by first modifying the parameters of the game's source code. We believe that helping students engage in modding can encourage more diverse learners to become interested in computer science and programming careers, so our game is not only fun to play but also a great way for players to engage in a unique and supportive CS learning experience !
